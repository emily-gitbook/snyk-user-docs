# Regional hosting and data residency

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

Regional hosting and data residency are available only for Enterprise plans. For more information, see [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans).
{% endhint %}

Data residency allows you to control the region in which Snyk hosts a selected subset of your data. For information about GDPR, see [How Snyk maintains GDPR compliance](how-snyk-handles-your-data.md#how-snyk-maintains-gdpr-compliance).

Data residency is available for [Snyk Open Source](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source/), [Snyk Code](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-code/), [Snyk Container](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/), and [Snyk IaC](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/). Snyk can host your data in a number of regions.

This page provides information on:

* [Regionally stored data types](regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#regionally-stored-data-types)
* [Globally stored data types](regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#globally-stored-data-types)
* [Available Snyk Regions](regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#available-snyk-regions)
* [Regional multi- and single-tenant hosting](regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#regional-multi-and-single-tenant-hosting)

A list of [regional URLs](regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#regional-urls) is also provided.

## Regional and global data

Snyk uses subprocessors to provide a high-quality service. Thus, not all data types can be stored within your region of choice. The list of subprocessors is available [on the Snyk website](https://snyk.io/policies/subprocessors/).

See [How Snyk handles your data](how-snyk-handles-your-data.md) for product-specific examples of how data is handled.

### Regionally stored data types

* Vulnerability data
* Vulnerability source
* Audit logs
* Integration-related data
* Customer source code

### Globally stored data types

* Billing data
* Customer relationship management data
* Operational logs and metrics
* Product analytics
* Support Tickets
* User authentication data

## Available Snyk Regions

{% hint style="warning" %}
After you select a region, the data in that region cannot be migrated to another region. Moving to a new region requires a complete re-onboarding.
{% endhint %}

During the initial onboarding of your system, you can work with your account team to select a multi-tenant hosting region. For single-tenant availability (Snyk Private Cloud), reach out to your account team in advance of onboarding. When using Snyk features, you will use specific URLs that differ from the SNYK-US-01 URL. See [Regional URLs](regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#regional-urls) for the list of URLs.

You must configure your environment to set your region before you authenticate. This does not apply when you are using the SNYK-US-01 URL. For details, see the [snyk config environment CLI help](../snyk-cli/commands/config-environment.md).

Snyk offers data residency for the following regions:

|                 Region                 |           URL          |
| :------------------------------------: | :--------------------: |
|             SNYK-US-01 (US)            |   https://app.snyk.io  |
|             SNYK-US-02 (US)            | https://app.us.snyk.io |
|     SNYK-EU-01 (Germany, Frankfurt)    | https://app.eu.snyk.io |
|         SNYK-AU-01 (Australia)         | https://app.au.snyk.io |
| SNYK-GOV-01 (Snyk for Government (US)) | https://app.snykgov.io |

Single-tenant deployments may support more regions than the ones listed here, subject to validation of architectural service supportability by Snyk engineering.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk AppRisk works across all regions. There is no need to set your region and use a specific URL.
{% endhint %}

## Regional multi- and single-tenant hosting

{% hint style="warning" %}
The SNYK-US-01 region is available to customers who joined before September 2024 and to Free plan users.
{% endhint %}

For Free or Team plan users in the SNYK-US-01 region, no configuration is required for URLs. For hosting in other regions, you must configure your environment for that region.

SNYK-US-02, EU, and AU data center Snyk accounts are available only with the purchase of an [Enterprise plan](https://snyk.io/plans/).

Snyk offers almost all the same features, support, and performance in the regional multi- and single-tenant regions as in SNYK-US-01. For an up-to-date overview of feature parity across regions, contact your account team.

All Snyk AppRisk features are supported in all multi-tenant environments, while for the single-tenant environment you need to check the availability with your account team.

## Integration considerations

There are special considerations when you set up specific integrations in your Snyk ecosystem.

* If you choose to install the Snyk Runtime Sensor using a Helm chart, you must provide the Snyk API base URL. You can find all the necessary details under step 5 of the [Using a Helm chart](../integrate-with-snyk/snyk-runtime-sensor.md#using-a-helm-chart) section of the Snyk Runtime Sensor documentation page.
* If you choose to set up third-party integrations, verify whether you need to specify the base API URL of the third-party

**SNYK-US-02** - `--set upstreamUrlCodeAgent=https://deeproxy.us.snyk.io`

**SNYK-EU-01 -** `--set upstreamUrlCodeAgent=https://deeproxy.eu.snyk.io`

### Broker with Snyk Code Local Engine (SCLE)

Set up your `values-customer-settings.yml` with the correct Broker Server URL for your region based on the values found in the [Broker URLs](regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#broker-urls) section.

Then add an extra variable to the `values-customer-settings.yml`:

**SNYK-US-02**\
`deeproxy:`\
`verificationEndpoint: "https://api.us.snyk.io/v1/validate/token/snyk-to-deepcode-proxy-validation"`

**SNYK-EU-01**\
