# Application vulnerabilities in Snyk Container and Snyk Open Source

Snyk Container detects application vulnerabilities in your containers and overlaps Snyk Open Source capabilities.\
\
The results from a Snyk Container application vulnerability scan and a Snyk Open Source scan are generally the same, especially if Snyk is building a dependency graph from the same manifest files.\
\
However, results can vary significantly depending on the ecosystem and how the developer builds the application. An application in a container is a compiled application. So, in some ecosystems, Snyk Open Source can scan a more detailed manifest and thus build a more accurate dependency graph:

* **`golang` Projects for Snyk Containers**: Snyk does not have access to the list of dependencies as in Snyk Open Source. Therefore, Snyk Container reverse parses binaries, and the result differs slightly from Snyk Open Source.
* **`npm` packages as Snyk Containers**: Snyk can access the list of dependencies. The result is generally the same as that of Snyk Open Source. For details, see [Open Source and licensing](../../../supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks/javascript/#open-source-and-licensing).
* **`java` applications for Snyk Containers**: In Open Source, it is possible to include unmanaged jars (see [Scan all unmanaged jar files](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/scan-all-unmanaged-jar-files.md)). Thus the result is different from Snyk Container.
  * With Snyk Container, the scan traverses all the jars Snyk finds in the image (see [Detect application vulnerabilities in container images](../use-snyk-container/detect-application-vulnerabilities-in-container-images.md)). In addition, there are multiple ways to build a jar, and the method used affects how Snyk Container finds the dependencies.
  * In Snyk Open Source, if there are multiple potential versions of a dependency, the package manager dependency resolution logic ensures that only one version is selected. However, in Snyk Container, unpacked jars may contain other versions of dependencies, and because they all exist in the container, they are all reported.
