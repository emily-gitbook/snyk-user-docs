You can use the **Inventory** page to organize your repository assets, enabling you to visualize all repository assets from your SCM tools, track Snyk product control coverage, and prioritize coverage mitigation based on business impact.

Each line in the inventory represents either a repository asset or a scanned artifact from Snyk that is likely a repository but lacks some identifying information. Scanned artifacts are not supported through Policies.
